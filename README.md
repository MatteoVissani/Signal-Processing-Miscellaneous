# Signal-Processing-Miscellaneous
Core scripts that I use in my analysis of signal processing

(in update)
Set of core scripts that I use for my analysis (LFP, EEG, KIN, etc.):
- mycwt:  compute continuous wavelet transform using Morlet wavelets with different number of cycles.
- compute_SpectralInformation: compute mutual information of power at single frequency about different conditions.
